A rewrite of a previous ReactJS app in AngularJS

#### Motivation
I wanted an application to code to help me get better at AngularJS so I rewrote an app previous written in ReactJS. See [react-challenge](https://github.com/jeffreywalters/react-challenge). 

#### Under the Hood
 - [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
 - [BootStrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
 - [UI Bottstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap)
 - [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
 - [Angular UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
